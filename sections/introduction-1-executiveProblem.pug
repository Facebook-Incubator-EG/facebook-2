p If it is true that "
  i you are what you eat
  |", then in the information age, "
  i you are what you know
  |". If your information diet is composed almost exclusively of puppies, memes, and selfies, then maybe you want to be aware of it. If you have 500 contacts, but your timeline is composed of the same 30 friends, you should be able to understand why. This is nothing less than a distorted perception of reality, a reality that is given to users by social networks. Facebook does not provide statistics or clarity as to why it shows you certain things related to your interest. Analytics can help the user to assess how they are using the platform, if the interaction is productive and the amount of time they spent.

p At the moment, we see a debate on Facebook algorithm influence solely based on anecdotal references. This is true because of the very nature of the Facebook experience. The timeline is ephemeral and personalised, and Facebook doesn’t provide any information as to how or why information is shown in the timeline. Once the user refreshes the page, that chunk of information is lost.
