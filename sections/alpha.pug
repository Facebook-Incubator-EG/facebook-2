h3 The experience got during the Alpha

p The initial development phase went since June 2016 to September, then the alpha stage last since the begin of September to the begin of December. The goal of the alpha was showing the project, get person engaged, understand assets, concerns and priorities. It went fairly well:

ul.fb--icon-list
  li A team has been created, partnership are explored, along a refined vision for the project
  li Language and word based parsers are awful, but sometime are necessary. This require an infrastructure replanning, because the languages in the world are many and do not exists only English.
  li Privacy issues has been discussed and, a 
    a(href="/privacy-statement") Privacy Statement
    |  has been defined and specified 
  li Four 
    a(href="/initiatives") talks
    |  has been done on this subject, helping us to reach 95 users in this phase.
  li We broke the previous visualisations, The database format is changed and the previous approach has stop to work by the end of Novemberâ€¦ showing the intrinsic limits of the prototypal technology :)

h3 Why the parsing can't be client side?
p because Facebook changes often the HTML structure, and sometime changes only for a small group of users. The analysis might be broken most of the time if we do that, and we can measure it only when it is later. #truestory:
