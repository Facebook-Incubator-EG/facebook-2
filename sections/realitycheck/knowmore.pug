h3 roadmap
p.text Data stored is not personal in a sense we do not collect what the user do or send to Facebook. What we have, could implicitly reflect your interests.

  li privacy preserving mechanism is in development, at the moment we are sharing only the data of dummy users. Before sharing the data of actual users, we want to define an ethical agreement with researchers and an anonymization logic of the data.
  li authentication: the user can share the access to the timeline, to whom they want. The informative diet has to be accessible to the user. There is some technical complexity to be solved because we do not manage login, password or Facebook access token. 

p.text It is public on facebook who you follow, and we are talking about a sophisticated corporate surveillance technology: what is on facebook is lost without any hope. Still, we do not want to help any further data exploitation.

h3 problems
