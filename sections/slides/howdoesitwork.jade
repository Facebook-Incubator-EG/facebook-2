        li.fragment the Extension, 
          b monitors and scrapes  
          | the Supporter feed, when it finds a public shared post, it collects the HTML section, and sends it to a server

        li.fragment All other content, for example the one shared with friends only, are ignored

      ul
        li Personalisation algorithms influence the collectively, and collectively have to be analyzed
