        h2 Hi! it is 2018, and this project run over a major update cycle, but first:
        p.grateful Thanks for being resilient and contributing to the project.
        p.grateful.left-link Despite the apparence, the project is doing OK. 
            b Besides...
            | We didn't yet offer features to you! 
            | because it turn out, we achieved 
            a(href="/initiatives") exciting results in research
            |, and this was simpler than develop an UX. 
        p.grateful Now the things are going to change, perhaps. Since version 1.1.15 (released 2018-07-17), the new personal dashboard has begun to be deployed.
        p.grateful.left-link What happened in the last 12 months of

        h2 On C4  
        p.text C4 is meant to provide a reusable optimal collaboration model for open source software projects. It has these specific goals:
        ul.fb--icon-list
            li To maximize the scale and diversity of the community around a project, by reducing the friction for new Contributors and creating a scaled participation model with strong positive feedbacks;
            li To relieve dependencies on key individuals by separating different skill sets so that there is a larger pool of competence in any required domain;
            li To allow the project to develop faster and more accurately, by increasing the diversity of the decision making process;
            li To support the natural life cycle of project versions from experimental through to stable, by allowing safe experimentation, rapid failure, and isolation of stable code;
            li To reduce the internal complexity of project repositories, thus making it easier for Contributors to participate and reducing the scope for error;
            li To enforce collective ownership of the project, which increases economic incentive to Contributors and reduces the risk of hijack by hostile entities.
