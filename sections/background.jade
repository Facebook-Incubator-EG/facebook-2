  p Since its rise in 2004, Facebook has grown into the largest social networking service online. Gathering almost 2 billions of active users a month, the resulting data generated by the community makes it extremely difficult for the users to acquire and process relevant information in a meaningful way. To overcome the problem of information overload, Facebook has started to deploy personalization algorithms. 

  p Personalization algorithms are tools to customize information, determining its importance for a specific user. On the basis of usersâ€™ identity and interactions, specific bits of information are preferred while other are hidden from her view. By deploying this filtering mechanism, Facebook ensure that each user can have a meaningful experience of the service, instead of dealing with an unorganized information flow. 

  p Personalization algorithms have to be judged positively in its potential to engage with basic human need in the information era: reduce information overload, increase its scope and usability, and support users autonomy of making informed choices. However, while algorithms facilitate the managing of information, new researches have shown evidences that this benefit is largely balanced by the social and individual negative effect of filtering.
